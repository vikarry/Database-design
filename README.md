# Database-design


The COVID-19 outbreak in recent years has exposed several issues with the healthcare systems across the world.
Governments are exploring ways in which they can reduce the strain on the hospital systems by oâ€€oading non-critical
healthcare to other institutions.

A great example of this is the Midwifery (Sage-femme) program run by the Quebec Ministry of Health. This
program allows pregnant couples to receive support and basic health care services through a personalized midwife
(who is medically trained and certifed) and not be caught up in the bureaucratic rigmarole and intimidation of a
hospital-based environment.

Develop a database (and associated application) to manage the Midwifery services
across the province.
